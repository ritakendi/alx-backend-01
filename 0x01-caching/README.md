A caching system is a type of memory management system that stores frequently-accessed data in a way that makes it faster to retrieve than if it were stored in main memory or on a hard drive. Caching systems are often used to improve the performance of computer systems by reducing the number of times that data needs to be retrieved from slower memory or storage devices.

A caching system typically consists of a cache memory, also known as cache store, and a cache management algorithm. The cache memory stores a copy of the data that has been retrieved from the main memory or storage, while the cache management algorithm is used to determine which data should be stored in the cache and which data should be evicted when the cache is full. The algorithm uses different strategies such as LRU (Least Recently Used), LFU (Least Frequently Used) to determine which data should be kept in the cache.

Caching systems can be implemented at different levels of a system, such as the operating system level, the application level, or the network level. They can be used in a wide range of applications, such as web caching, database caching, and file caching.
